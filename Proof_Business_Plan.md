## Mission

Our mission at Proof is build easy-to-use tools that automate processes of risk management, financial instrument creation, and order fulfillment in blockchain-enabled markets.


## Company Summary

Proof is an open-source software company, focused on insurance and risk management markets. Proof generates revenue when positive resolutions to fixed-term insurance policies actuate. Proof does not act as an insurer. Companies  create policies using Proof’s toolsets to generate digital smart contracts, which, in turn, are governed by monetary transaction events of the issuing company. Proof bares no exposure or financial risk to insurance claims. Companies create policies via proof tools, crowdsourcing the financing that pay the claims.

Proof software acts as a connector of a double sided insurance market whereby one group insures a digital asset against losses and another group stakes capital to signal risk that there will be loss. All of this activity and the capital involved is stored on the Ethereum blockchain, a decentralised and immutable digital network independent of Proof. 

Proof software primarily facilitates insurance-product transactions such as securities fraud insurance and corporate default insurance. Proof does not file claims. Proof does not create these insurance products. Companies and their partners create these policies using digital smart contracts, which are governed by monetary transaction events of the issuing company. Proof does not have any financial exposure to these insurance policies. Companies create policies and crowdsource the financing that pay out the claims. Proof does not participate in these activities. 

The Ethereum blockchain has proven a reliable source for storing ever-changing custody records, as it is immune from most types of conventional cyberattacks that have affected networks such as SWIFT. 

Proof crowdsources the marketing of insurance policies via the AMP application, a peer-to-peer, censorship resistant desktop application used by retail investors and funds. AMP is a financial messaging tool for broadcasting messages onto the blockchain and sharing risk predictions. As the first of its kind Proofs has thousands of users who leverage other Proof products. 

AMP has an unparalleled advantage in the blockchain-based insurance market. Insurance markets are rapidly developing as new blockchain use-cases emerge. Simultaneously a benefit and a challenge, securities can be created and transferred relatively easily, often without government oversight. This creates investor risk which decentralised insurance markets can address. As laws change and digital assets (or securities) are deemed compliant or illegal, token holders or investors will need protection from both changes in policies, bad actors, and natural disasters alike.

The crypto hedge fund industry is growing rapidly with more and more institutions experimenting with blockchain technology.


## Standards & Compliance

Proof ensures regulatory compliance by working alongside both regulators, industry experts, and by analyzing industry trends and data to ensure that the technology meets best-in-class standards. 

By being one of the trailblazers in the early stages of the blockchain industry we play an important role in helping establish standards that both users and governments can come to a consensus on. We at Proof believe that blockchain technology is not going away, and helping to bridge regulators with industry leaders is important for  a healthy growing blockchain ecosystem.

Proof is primed to fill the appetites of crypto-investors seeking security and stability. By generating standardised smart contracts that follow the Assurance Market Protocol, Proof synchronizes the flow of financial messages on the blockchain, acting as an automated mission control for blockchain-enabled markets. 


## Company Structure

Proof is an Estonian-based company, operating in  South Korea (Seoul) and The US (LA).  The Seoul and US companies are branch offices and subsidiaries, respectively. The purpose of the country division is for tax and regulatory purposes. Estonia has 0% corporate profit taxes which is good for token “sales”. Estonia has forbearing laws concerning blockchain allowing for the opening of domestic bank accounts.  

In order to navigate the complicated and shifting compliance landscape of the blockchain industry, Proof has placed its primary entity in a blockchain-friendly nation while building its various operations out as subsidiaries.  Through these subsidiaries, Proof has enlisted the help of one of South Korea’s most auspicious Law Firms, HMP Law as well as a legal advisory panel made up of blockchain legal specialists from Hong Kong, The United States, and South Korea.

These subdivided operations also allow for greater coordination between a diverse team of advisors, developers, and business development specialists allowing Proof to operate under the ‘around the world’ ethos.
 

## Founding Members

Proof was founded by Mike De’Shazer, David Van Isacker and Tai Kersten in May of 2016, originally named ‘The Think Consortium on Blockchain.’ Think was created by the three founders as a research group, studying industry trends in the emerging blockchain ecosystem. Think partnered with companies such as IBM, PwC and other blue chip firms to help create proof-of-concepts based on Think’s research and development expertise.

In November of 2016, the company was renamed Proof and the mission evolved to making blockchain-enabled markets accessible to anyone. The company created the Proof Dashboard, the first web-based Ethereum token generator and Ethereum token store front. The Dashboard also featured a simple bitcoin, ethereum and US dollar conversion tool. As the Dashboard’s user base grew, Proof’s developers created peripheral services including the ICO landing page generator (ICO MKR) and the tokenized asset legal agreement generator (LAGAB), as well as the mobile version of the Dashboard web application, featuring NFC and QR code-capabilities. 

The core team brings extensive experience with application, web, and blockchain development as well as years of entrepreneurial experience spanning tech, academia, and crypto-currencies.

Mike De’Shazer is the CEO of Proof. With 12 years of software development and management experience and over 40 applications built that have served millions of users, Mike leads product and corporate strategy.

Tai Kersten is the CTO of Proof. A seasoned entrepreneur, early blockchain engineer and best-in-class Python and node.js developer, Tai leads technology stack development and maintenance, ensuring best practices security, speed and availability. Tai focuses on the consumer facing technology stack.

David Van Isacker is the CIO of Proof. After earning a Master’s in computer and mechanical engineering from Seoul National University, David joined Proof as the youngest founding member. David heads internal development processes and smart contract audits. 


## Marketing Plan

Proof’s marketing plan consists of social media being a cornerstone of Proof’s brand development and constant customer interaction.  Blog posts, videos, LinkedIn engagement, Reddit, BitcoinTalk, our Slack community, Telegram group, Facebook, and Twitter posts act as great toolsets to driving brand awareness of Proof as experts in the blockchain tokenisation space.  We plan to use this toolset for our three-pronged approach to advancing market share in Proofs’ two verticals.  

The first vertical is the investment community, consisting of institution, alternative investors, and retail investors who leverage Proof’s AMP desktop application to trade blockchain-based tokens, representing real-world assets.

The second vertical consists of issuers who create tokens. These issuers are a diverse array of companies. This also includes existing blockchain-based tokens that do not represent, necessarily, real-world assets, such as Bancor, TenX’s PAY, Golem, Storj and other tokens. In the beginning, these tokens will provide the most liquidity as they already have large trading volumes across existing exchanges. 



# Market Landscape

Due to distrust based on recent events including the government shutdown of BTC-e and hacks of exchanges such as Bitfinex, there has been a push among serious investors for decentralised exchanges. Currently, there are EtherDelta and Kyber, which, as web applications, are still open to government censorship. 

Additionally, their user interfaces are not as robust as Proof’s AMP.  We anticipate quite a bit of adoption of the platform by current blockchain investors as we integrate with these decentralised exchanges and bring their liquidity pools onto AMP. From there, investors will see new offerings which have issuer credit scores and insurance-based risk scores for real-world assets and will funnel into the new asset classes. 

Ultimately, we see Proof fulfilling the demand for fully decentralised exchanges that are censorship and hacking resistant. 


## Proof Consulting

Currently, Proof is building out a global consulting team to work with companies interested in learning how AMP works and the benefits of their assets on the blockchain. 

At the moment, we are leveraging our educational videos on our YouTube channel that span subjects from how to leverage Proof to launching token sales and adding real world assets to the blockchain. Our content has gained us 1,000 subscribers with views of up to 50,000 per video and growing. These videos have given us proof that there is a demand for technical know-how and support while additionally serving  as a funnel for passive deal flow for companies and serving as an engagement point for prospective partners. Enterprises have reached out to Proof to get professional assistance in launching their properties, companies, and projects onto the blockchain.

We are ramping up these efforts by expanding Proof’s day-to-day management dealings while continuing to build customer trust which helps to facilitate further consulting opportunities.  Finding these opportunities will allow us to further expand the consulting service into a full-featured Proof Consulting & Global Blockchain Services group. 

Set to launch in January of 2018, Proof Consulting will filter and work with medium to large brands to develop new revenue streams, while bringing more opportunities onto the AMP desktop application from which users will be able to purchase tokens.


## Derivatives, Crypto-Funds & Institutional Investors

To further attract more liquidity into the overall crypto-market from sophisticated investors, especially around real world assets, Proof will benefit from its diverse non-physical and physically-backed blockchain token offerings, which are currently not available in the market. 

Into the future, Proof will also expand its services, consultation, and technology divisions into working with expanding crypto-funds and crypto-hedge-funds.  Since we are working on bringing more assurable assets into the marketplace, involvement with these groups starting with defining evolving business problems and ending with building robust marketplaces backed by AMP technology will be highly fruitful for the future of Proof.

Although with the rise of tokensales, decentralized market-spaces, and further saturation of non-centralized currencies there is speak of disruption and replacement, there will always be wisdom in the experiences and protocols laid down by more traditional investors.  Proof seeks to claim some of the more beneficial 

Likewise, as Proof expands its own holdings, the potential for establishing its own company fund is high. Specifically, Proof seeks to begin supporting forward thinking blockchain initiatives and incentivizing high level developers and thinkers from both within and without the crypto-space to get involved.  A ‘Developer Fund’ as it were.  Market dynamics and competition aside, this is a young industry as of 2017 and there is still a lot of work to be done towards enriching the commons wherein Proof seeks to take yet another leadership role.


## Technology

Proof’s primary open-source application is the AMP desktop application. This application hosts Proof’s existing and past products but is completely decentralised and features a double-sided insurance and risk singling markets for privatized, crowdsourced and decentralised regulatory oversight. 

This application is a paradigm shift in the way retail investors assess risk and in how institutional investors and analysts can signal risk to the markets, by stating their predictions with financial backing. Unlike other markets where participants create derivatives that depend on centralized insurance companies (like AIG during the financial crisis of 2008), all funds are stored using cryptocurrency such as Ethereum or Proof’s crypto-fiat  in order to ensure fungibility, preventing the risk of over-leveraging and government bailouts. 

Furthermore, the AMP desktop application is built to be censorship-resistant, encrypted, and completely peer-to-peer so that governments cannot sensor financial transactions of participants. This also allows participants the option of utilizing the platform anonymously. 

As the application is open source (openly available to anyone), this means that banning the software is not an option as there is no company to penalize for the distribution of the software.  Proof benefits by owning 50% of the issued Proof tokens (PRFT) and thus receiving rewards as the markets become more liquid. 

Along with the upcoming AMP and decentralized marketplace, Proof has an existing suite of products that empower users to work with blockchain technologies to support their assets and crypto-currencies:

*Proof Dashboard*

The Proof Dashboard is the flagship product of Proof’s initial launch, allowing users to create assets and place them on the blockchain with the assistance of the following tools.  Currently, the dashboard has over 10,000 users and thousands of assets.  Moving forward, Proof will fully overhaul the dashboard, molding it into a completely decentralized mission control for assets built upon the AMP.

*Mobile Application*  

The mobile application is a fully-functional currency and token wallet allowing for users to transfer assets and tokens across NFC and QR-code interfaces.

*Token Legal Agreement Generator*

Users can utilize The Token Legal Agreement Generator to draft a region-specific legal document connecting an asset to the owner and the owner to their constituents.

*ICO MKR*

The ICO MKR enables users to create a custom homepage for their token as well as a location to host and promote their crypto-asset sale.






## Internal Tools

Proof utilizes a collection of tools to manage, assess, and orchestrate both its technology stack and business operations.  The platform is built upon cloud-based Infrastructure services provided by Amazon Web Services and platforms such as Heroku and Open Shift.  For analytics, Proof utilizes Mixpanel and HotJar to assess user heuristics in real time. Tawk and a collection of communication tools such as Slack and Telegram round out Proof’s user outreach infrastructure.


## Operations & Management Strategy

The overall operations and management strategies leverages by Proof fall under the purview of 3 core principles:

Always have a clear value proposition to users for any initiative that can be summed up in 1 sentence and make even the average person on the street interested without use of the “and this too” phrase. For Proof’s core that message could be summed up as: “Create your own currency”.

Find the secret sauces that competitors cannot copy, even the most well-funded and talented teams with their brightest minds. In Proof’s case, this is the brand of being first into the market with the earliest content and the best crypto-assets, matched with trust in the company produced crypto-fiat and artificial intelligence for identifying news that interests investors based on their investments.

Harness a close relationship with your most active customers to ensure the product evolves in a manner that is relevant to their needs and considers the meta-game of the ever-evolving technology market landscape.


## Management

Proof’s management ethos centers around the concept of a ‘Dynamic Hierarchy’ wherein an individual proposes an initiative with a comprehensible and easy to grasp value proposition.  In order to proceed, the individual must develop, plan, and manage the project, enlisting interested parties from the company and taking full control and responsibility of the outcome.

This differs from a ‘flat’ management structure in that final approval must run through the core founders however, once underway, the managing party can enlist the help and delegate to any interested members of the company, taking on the role of project lead.
     


## Culture

Proof’s culture is entered around openness and ideas-over-politics. While being politically correct can keep an institution out of “trouble”, Proof values an open dialogue about any subject.  Often this means that values, ideas, and past experiences will be challenged or offended.

Through open communication, the Proof Team prides itself as a company of individuals who bring both the virtuous and ill of their personalities to the overall whole, seeking an equilibrium between the individual and the overall working environment.

Proof is focused on fostering a culture of uncontained openness, ensuring equanimity and honesty along gender, racial, ideological, national, work-habit, and behavioural norms.  


## The Proof Handbook

The Proof Handbook is an onboarding tool for all new Proof team members which focuses on the three following areas:

Respect of colleagues while being honest about biases and prejudices.

Team-individual balance. Not everyone in a team can agree to a course of action, however, through debate and discourse, the team can craft a company simultaneously serving mutual self interest and overall betterment. 

Effect not time. Proof is an organization that believes in making meetings and coming to work on time, however, there is a greater emphasis on getting tasks completed by the deadline, no matter what unconventional paths that might take.

New employees will undergo a probationary period of two months without public acknowledgement to ensure a proper fit. The on-boarding process is focused on always keeping Proof in “startup-mode” and that is ensuring ordered chaos and obtaining talent that can fit into learning by doing in the process of the company moving through its processes. The handbook is updated regularly by inductees and veteran staff to improve the boarding studies of future inductees.



## Employee Stakeholders

Proof does not offer stock options to its employees, but instead entitles employees to percentages of the dividends via  Proof tokens on the blockchain that employees can hold to obtain bonuses or part of their severance package. Employees have the right to trade their tokens before and after being employed with the company, as this is part of our business culture.


## Payroll

Payroll is handled by Proof’s accounting firm in Korea, which ensures tax compliance and also ensures payment to all employees. Employees are given many options around allocation of their months payments based on their retirement plans and can be adjusted every 6 months.


## Legal

HMP Law, one of Korea’s largest law firms, represents Proof and has a close relationship with financial regulatory officers to ensure regulatory compliance. Likewise, Scott Thiel, senior partner of the second largest law firm in the world, sits on Proof’s board of directors. Scott manages thought leadership around blockchain technology at DLA Piper and its enterprise-level clients. 



## Vision

At Proof, we envision a world where individuals and companies have full financial sovereignty powered by blockchain technology. We foresee a global phenomenon, which we are helping to accelerate through our tools that connect market participants, that brings more access to people of any income bracket to obtain stakes in local and international businesses and projects, in safer markets than traditionally regulated ones we have today through tokenization on the blockchain.

This will bring about:

* More efficient valuation methodologies in real estate and infrastructure projects

* Less centralized and more secure digital banking solutions for consumers

* Next generation retirement plans in the age of the digital nomads in the gig economy

* Better marketplaces where large financial institutions and everyday people can come together with enhanced transparency across asset classes.

We hold the belief that democratizing ownership through tokenziation will provide the incentives for communities to improve their own sustainability processes to protect their long-term value and investment return. This is the alternative to relying on a few folks far away to care about and look after various local communities' long-term interests and processes of sustainability.
